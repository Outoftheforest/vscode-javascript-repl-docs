This extension uses under the hood a modified version of [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) bundler. So I would like to say a big thank you to the guys there. You can find the modified version at the following [branch](https://github.com/axilleasiv/parcel/tree/vs-repl).

## Inspiration

I'd like to give a shout out to [Quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com), which is a significantly more comprehensive and covers a lot more editors, if this extension interests you - check out that too. Also, when I started to play around this, I started with the code of the following [extension](https://github.com/lostfields/vscode-nodejs-repl)
